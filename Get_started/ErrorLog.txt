##########Frequently got errors##########
#### MAIN ####
Error in setwd(path_R_scripts) : cannot change working directory
= forget to change path of computer, or typing error in folder "R_scripts" (eg. Rscripts)

Error in setwd(path_data_in) : cannot change working directory
= path is correct, problem: projectname wrong (eg written with space), non-existent folder to input (development after source config w wrong name)

Error : cannot allocate vector of size 7.8 Mb
or 
killed during process 
= not enough RAM for R pipeline to compute (probably step annotate from part pre-processing Thermo), increase RAM of Rbox if possible

Not engough space
= hard drive is full, free up space for calculating

Error in file(file, ifelse(append, "a", "w")) : cannot open the connection
= close excel, close other files opened, check path in main.r correct 

Error in file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding): cannot open the connection
Calls: source -> file
In addition: Warning message: In file (filename, "r", encoding = encoding): cannot open file 'configuration.R': No such file or directory
Execution halted
= configuration.r.r extension is wrong, check configuration.r instead of twice suffix .r

(process:5453): Pango-WARNING **: Invalid UTF-8 string passed to pango_layout_set_text()
= created/exported txt can be in wrong format (incorrect UTF-8), copy/paste from txt to txt to solve.


####PART 1b: Targeted analysis####
REIMS:
Warning messages:
1: In scan(file = file, what = what, sep = sep, quote = quote, dec = dec,  :
  EOF within quoted string
2: In scan(file = file, what = what, sep = sep, quote = quote, dec = dec,  :
  number of items read is not a multiple of the number of column
= wrong load of targeted metadata, because non acceptable symbol in file: eg. ', /, +, -, ...

Error: nrow(targetedMetadata) == nrow(targetedMetadata[targetedMetadata$IonisationMode ==  .... is not TRUE
= in column ionisation mode only + or - is accepted, no +Na, ?, empty cell, ...

Error: nrow(targetedMetadata) > min_samples is not TRUE
= need at least 2 standards in targetedMetadata

Error in -ncol(variableMetadata_output) : 
  invalid argument to unary operator
Calls: source -> withVisible -> eval -> eval
= theoretical m/z deviates to much from the measured m/z for all standards, so could not find any metabolites, empty df and script stops
